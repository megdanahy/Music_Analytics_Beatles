# Music Analytics: The Beatles Discography 🎵

### This is a trend analysis done via python, using The Beatles's discography. I wanted to understand the stylistic changes happening during the short stint one of my favorite bands.

[This notebook](beatles_analysis.ipynb) shows the jupyter notebook with python code to extract, transform, and load the data into vs.code. I then utilized the clean data to analyze the:

🎶 Danceability 🎶 Energy 🎶 Liveness 🎶 Valence 🎶
  
 per Beatles album, so I could see how they correlate or change over time.

 The Beatles are one of my all time favorite bands, so this was a way to use data analytics how it's supposed to be used-- to find information we actually want to know.

From this anlaysis, I have noted three key insights:
1. Their music's energy generally decreased as The Beatles' recording career continued.
2. Their individual albums had wider energy distribution, meaning the energy per album remained somewhat variable. This could mean they treid to appeal to a wider audience with differing opinions on high energy songs.
3. Distribution of danceability remained somewhat concentrated, but was more variable on their more conceptual albums which makes sense. The widest distribution can be found on The White Album, and Yellow Submarine-- two albums that were revered for being off the beaten path, and more story reliant.
