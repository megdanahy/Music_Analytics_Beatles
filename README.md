# Music Analytics: The Beatles Discography 🎵

### This is a trend analysis done via python, using The Beatles's discography. I wanted to understand the stylistic changes happening during the short stint one of my favorite bands.

The notebook shows the jupyter notebook with python code to extract, transform, and load the data into vs.code. I then utilized the clean data to analyze the:

🎶 Danceability
🎶 Energy
🎶 Liveness
🎶 Valence
  
 per Beatles album, so I could see how they correlate or change over time.

 The Beatles are one of my all time favorite bands, so this was a way to use data analytics how it's supposed to be used-- to find information we actually want to know.
